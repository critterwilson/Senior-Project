# Bar-Down Hockey Player Detector

Bar-Down is a Computer Vision project created with the intent of identifying hockey players in footage.

## Usage
### Streaming a Video
In the 'YouTube URL' entry field, the user may enter a YouTube URL. The video will open up in a new window with the machine learning model  running on the video. 

In the 'File' field, the user may select a downloaded .mp4 file to run the machine learning model on. 

Select 'Run' to open a new window with the stream.

Select 'Quit' to close the application.

#### *Note:
If both fields have values entered into them, the YouTube video will take precedence and run. In other words, if you would like to run the system on a local file, you must remove all text from the YouTube URL field.

### During the Stream
p = Pause video

[any key, during pause] = Resume video

q = Close the video
